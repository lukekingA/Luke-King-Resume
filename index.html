          <p>
            Currently I'm pursuing a career in software engineering and
            development. I have been studying self guided since early 2017 and
            have become more and more interested in this field for my career. I
            decided to take the Immersive Full Stack course at Boise Code Works
            to level up what I had learned so far and help fill in any gaps in
            what I had learned on my own. My past work has been mainly
            agriculture. I have been an owner/partner in two farming ventures
            and one contract farming company. In between I also was an owner
            /operator in a small trucking company that my brother and I ran for
            about nine years. Most recently my brother and ran a small
            construction company that also sold used farm irrigation equipment.
            It might seem that to go from agriculture to software is a dramatic
            change in directions, but there are many skills such as problem
            analysis, project priority structuring, project and personnel
            management, and resource allocation that will be valuable skills to
            have in this industry. Being a small business I have been constantly
            building or repairing. I use different tools now but problem solving
            approaches learned before will continue to benefit me as I move
            ahead.
